# Shaowu Lei

> Nothing to fear if you hold the truth in your hand <br>
> Nothing is narrow if you have the justice in your mind

The greatest and most mighty scientist around the world.



## Lei's Mathematics

- Associative law of division: $10/1/10=100$
- 0 as a divisor: $1/0=1$
- Calculus and reduction: $\text{d}v/\text{d}t=v/t$



## Lei's Mechanics

- Newton's classical mechanics is totally wrong.

  > Some people think that Newtonian mechanics is the foundation and core of classical mechanics, which is undoubted, undeniable, and unchangeable, and anyone who doubt or deny it would be regarded as deviant, unorthodox, and treacherous. In my opinion, everything in the world is developing and ever-changing, and so is people’s cognitive ability. Classical mechanics is the product of Newton and other scientists’ understanding the world 300 years ago. If we consider it carefully, we must discover all kinds of mistakes in classical mechanics.

  > *--- Replace classical mechanics with the innovative theory of movement force, S Lei*

- Only **the innovative theory of movement force** can perfectly solve problems which Newton cannot.

  **Movement force** is the force that enables an object to move, whether external forces exist or not.

  Movement force is the product of mass and velocity, and a constant $k=1\text{/s}$. The formula is as follows:

  $$
  L=kmv
  $$

  Where $k$ is the constant mentioned above, $m$ is the mass of the moving object, and $v$ is its velocity.

- It is **improper** to describe the position of an object using the concept of **the reference system**. The location of any object or mass can only be described as **"its unique location"**.



## Lei's Electromagnetism



## Lei's Thermology



## Lei's Chemistry



## Lei's Biology



## Lei's Language

- Too awful too awful
- No knowledge, no virtue (unknowledgeable and virtueless)
- I don't argue with 4-no (or 4-less, i.e. knowledge-less, virtueless, shameless, and logicless) people.
- Watch the tower owner: extremely empty, extremely terrified, like a dog shouting around, extremely shameless!
- Can't see clearly. If there is movement, calculate it with $L=kmv$.
- Your expression is unclear. Go do experiments, then tell us the results.
